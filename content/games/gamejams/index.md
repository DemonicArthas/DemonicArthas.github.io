### Bury Me

You were betrayed... And now you need to bury your own body while being a ghost.

Puzzle game with some strategic and platformer elements.

Collaborative project where I was responsible for all of the programming/logic/game mechanics. Also helped with some of the level-design.

### Tales of the Past

Prototype for an action-adventure game similar to Witcher III.

Team project. I was tasked with creating most of the game's logic (stance and fighting system, magic system, leveling system, quests, etc.)

### Boss Fight (Saber Interactive Technical Interview)

A small test project for my Saber Interactive technical interview. 

Featuring a single boss fight with a couple of player/game mechanics, multiple boss phases and changing attack patterns, along with a few surprises and suprisingly polished tutorial section. And a Furi soundtrack, because it's awesome.
