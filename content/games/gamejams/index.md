These are some of my miscellaneous game jam games, freelance work or other small projects I've worked on.

### Latibulum

Prepare to be a hunter... and a victim.

A walking sim with some minor horror and action elements and a unique "different perspective" switch throghout the story.

Solo project

### Bury Me

You were betrayed... And now you need to bury your own body while being a ghost.

Puzzle game with some strategic and platformer elements.

Collaborative project where I was responsible for all of the programming/logic/game mechanics. Also helped with some of the level-design.

### Tales of the Past

Prototype for an action-adventure game similar to Witcher III.

Team project. I was tasked with creating most of the game's logic (stance and fighting system, magic system, leveling system, quests, etc.)
